## Architecture

- **Electron app** — main process (`main.js`) handles clipboard polling, tray, global shortcuts, IPC, sync
- **Preload bridge** (`preload.js`) — contextBridge exposing API to renderer
- **Single-file UI** (`index.html`) — loaded via `loadFile`, images served via `clip-img://` custom protocol
- **Cross-platform**: macOS + Windows. Platform differences handled inline with `process.platform` checks
- Data: `clipboard-history.json`, `clipboard-images/`, `clipboard-settings.json`

## Key Data Model

- **History item ids**: text items use a sha256 content key (`txt:{hash}`); image items use their content-addressed image filename (`img:{file}`).
- **`pin` field** on history items: `null`/absent means unpinned; an object means pinned. Shape is `{ number?: 1-9, groups?: string[], updatedAt?: number }`.
- **Legacy migration**: `lib/clipboard-model.js` migrates old `pinned`/`group` fields into the unified `pin` object before merging or rendering.
- **Groups**: group names live in `settings.groups`; item membership lives in `item.pin.groups`.
- **Tombstones**: deleted items and groups are retained for 30 days in settings so sync cannot resurrect removals from stale providers.
- **Content-addressed images**: filenames are md5 hash of PNG content (`{hash}.png`), naturally deduplicates.

## Clipboard Operations

- **Polling** every 400ms via `clipboard.readImage()` / `clipboard.readText()`
- **`addToHistory(entry, matchFn)`** — shared helper that deduplicates, preserves pinned/group metadata, and prunes
- **`setClipboardToItem(item)`** — shared helper to write text or image to clipboard
- **Backup/restore**: `backupClipboard()` saves text/html/rtf/image, `restoreClipboard()` writes them back. Used by numpad quick-paste.
- **`pollGate`** flag pauses polling during paste sequences to prevent interference

## Paste Simulation

- **macOS**: `osascript` — activates frontmost app then sends `keystroke "v" using command down`. Required because `app.dock.hide()` means our app doesn't return focus on hide.
- **Windows**: VBScript `SendKeys "^v"` via temp file + `cscript`. Faster than PowerShell.

## Windows Specifics — Low-Level Keyboard Hook

**Why not `globalShortcut.register('Super+V')`?** On Windows, Windows Clipboard History (Settings → System → Clipboard) claims Win+V at the RegisterHotKey layer. Electron's globalShortcut uses RegisterHotKey internally, so registration silently fails — the return value is `false`. Same applies to Win+Numpad1-9. You cannot win this fight with the high-level API.

**What we do instead.** `lib/windows-hook-worker.js` installs a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook via koffi FFI on a dedicated worker thread. LL hooks sit *below* system shortcut handling, so we see (and can swallow) Win+V before Windows Clipboard History does. This matches the approach the pre-Electron Python version used with ctypes.

**Worker thread, not main thread.** The hook must be installed on a thread that runs a GetMessage loop — Windows delivers LL hook calls via messages posted to the installing thread's queue. Running it on Electron's main thread works for Win+V but risks hitting `LowLevelHooksTimeout` (default 300ms) whenever JS blocks the main thread, at which point Windows silently unregisters the hook. A dedicated worker with a tight GetMessage loop avoids that entirely.

**SharedArrayBuffer for state.** The worker is synchronously blocked inside `GetMessageW`, so it can't process messages from the main thread via `parentPort.on('message')`. For decisions that need real-time state (is the popup open? is slot N assigned?), main thread writes to a `SharedArrayBuffer` and the worker reads it from inside the hook callback. Layout: `[popupVisible, slot1..slot9, reserved]` as `Uint8Array`.

**Numpad UX.** Plain Num1-9 (no Win) is intercepted only if:
- The popup is open (→ assign current item to slot), OR
- The slot is already assigned (→ paste slot contents).

Otherwise the key passes through so normal numpad typing works. Main thread calls `windowsHook.setPopupVisible()` on show/hide and `windowsHook.setSlotAssignments(Set)` whenever history is saved (`syncHookState()` in main.js).

**koffi over native addon.** koffi is pure JS FFI with prebuilt binaries for every Electron ABI — no `electron-rebuild`, no C++ toolchain, no breakage across Electron upgrades. The Node modules that *do* block system shortcuts all require native compilation or don't actually block Windows-reserved keys (`node-global-key-listener` explicitly can't override them).

**Shutdown.** `worker.terminate()` kills the thread; Windows reclaims the hook on thread exit. A cleaner `PostThreadMessageW(WM_QUIT)` path would need the worker thread ID exposed via postMessage at startup — not worth the extra FFI surface for a quit-only code path.

## macOS Specifics

- **No click-away-to-close**: `app.dock.hide()` makes blur events unreliable on macOS. Close button (×) shown in header instead. Windows uses blur-to-hide normally.
- **`app.dock.hide()`** hides dock icon — tray-only app
- **Template tray icon**: `trayIcon.setTemplateImage(true)` for menu bar dark/light mode

## Native Cloud Sync

- **Default-on providers**: detected Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, and any legacy custom `sync_path` folder are enabled automatically. Settings stores only local opt-outs in `sync_disabled_paths`; provider choices are not synced between machines.
- **Multi-target convergence**: `syncMerge()` reads every enabled provider, folds all remote states into one canonical local state, then writes that canonical state back to every enabled provider. This makes multiple providers useful redundancy instead of separate silos.
- **Merge algorithm**: shared pure helpers in `lib/clipboard-model.js` merge histories by stable item id/content key, merge pin/group metadata, preserve tombstones, and dedupe numpad slots.
- **`syncMerge()`** runs on startup + every 30s + debounced 500ms after local changes.
- **`insideSync` flag** prevents overlapping sync passes and prevents `saveHistory()`/`saveSettingsFile()` from re-triggering sync while a merge is already running.
- **Only writes if changed** — compares JSON strings of remote files before atomic writes to skip no-op churn.
- **Images synced bidirectionally** — content-addressed filenames mean no conflicts.
- **Remote settings exclusions**: `sync_path`, `sync_disabled_paths`, and legacy `numpad_slots` are excluded from remote settings writes.
- **Cloud account discovery** lives in `lib/cloud-accounts.js`.
- **macOS**: detects Google Drive and OneDrive from `~/Library/CloudStorage/`, plus iCloud Drive from `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs`.
- **Windows**: scans Google DriveFS mount letters and labels from PSDrive descriptions, DriveFS preference cache/WAL strings, and recent DriveFS logs; also detects OneDrive environment folders and common iCloud Drive folders.

## Scripts & Process Management

- **`start.sh`/`start.bat`** — call kill script, verify no leftover processes, abort if kill failed, then launch Electron in background
- **`update.sh`/`update.bat`** — one-step production-safe update: refuse tracked local code edits by default, fast-forward from Git, install dependencies if Electron is missing or package files changed, then call the platform start script to relaunch. Set `BOARDCLIP_UPDATE_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` in a developer checkout to use `git pull --rebase --autostash`.
- **`kill.sh`/`kill.bat`** — match processes by this checkout's Electron binary to avoid killing other Electron apps (VS Code, Discord, etc.).
- **Single-instance lock** via `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` — second launch shows popup instead of starting duplicate
- **Auto-launch**: `app.setLoginItemSettings({ openAtLogin: true })` — toggled in Settings UI
- **Windows dev auto-launch**: un-packaged Electron writes `BoardClip.vbs` into the Startup folder and the VBS runs `start.bat` hidden. Avoid pointing login startup directly at `electron.exe`; without a stable working directory it can launch bare Electron or fail to start the app module.

## UI Patterns

- **`icon-btn` base class** — all small clickable icons share 24x24 rounded style. Variants: `.accent` (purple hover), `.danger` (red hover), `.close-btn` (bold ×)
- **Null-guard `it.text`** — always use `(it.text||'')` in templates
- **Filter tags**: built-in (dashed border), custom groups (solid border)
- **Confirm dialog** shared between numpad reassign, group delete, and clear all
- **Settings auto-save** — max age/size save on input change, no Save button
- **Dev auto-reload** — `fs.watch` on `index.html` triggers `reloadIgnoringCache()` (debounced 300ms)

## Debugging

- Run `npx electron .` directly (not via start.sh) to see stdout/stderr
- Main process errors go to terminal, renderer errors to DevTools (Cmd+Option+I)
